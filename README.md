# Lab-Adaptable-Bioreactor
By Mackenzie Sampson
iGEM 2020 Calgary

This code is for an automated airlift bioreactor.

This code was designed with an airlift bioreactor that is capable of sensing dissolved Oxygen, pH, and Temperature. 
While also regulating temperature and dissolved oxygen with a heater and pump.

Components list is as follows:

Arduino Uno
Geekstory Micro SD Card Module
Alertseal 32Gb Micro SD Card
Tongling 2-Channel Relay
KeeYees LM2596 Step-Down Buck Converter
12V 5A AC to DC Transformer
Gikfun DS1820 Temperature Sensor
Immersion Water Heater 1000 Watt
Gravity: Analog pH Sensor Pro
Gravity: Analog Dissolved O2 Sensor
Ecoplus 728450 Air Pump 3000L/H 

Please refer to DFRobots website for more information regarding the Gravity: 
Analog pH Sensor Pro and the Gravity: Analog Dissolved O2 Sensor.
